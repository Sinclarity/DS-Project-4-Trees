The mission of Winona State University is to educate and enlighten our citizenry at a distinctive 
institution: a community of learners dedicated to improving our world.

Located in the beautiful bluff country of the Mississippi River Valley, the Winona campus is 
largely residential and primarily serves a traditional student age population, while the Rochester 
campus serves primarily non-traditional students.
